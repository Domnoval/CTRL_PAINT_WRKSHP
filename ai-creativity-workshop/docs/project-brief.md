# Project Brief: AI Creativity Workshop Platform

## Executive Summary

An interactive online platform for AI Creativity 101 workshops where participants can log in during live presentations and experiment with various AI tools (image generators, text-to-image, logo creators) to collaboratively create creative assets like brand logos or rough painting drafts in real-time.

## Problem Statement

Online AI creativity workshops and presentations lack interactive tools for participants to immediately experiment with the AI technologies being discussed. Participants are forced to passively listen without hands-on experience, limiting engagement and learning effectiveness. Existing webinar platforms don't support real-time collaborative AI experimentation, creating a disconnect between presentation content and practical application.

## Proposed Solution

Build an online workshop platform that integrates directly with popular AI tools, allowing participants to access and experiment with AI creativity tools simultaneously during presentations. The platform will include real-time collaborative features, session management, and a presenter control panel for guiding workshop activities.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Workshop Participants
- Demographics: Professionals and enthusiasts in creative fields (designers, marketers, artists) aged 25-50
- Current behaviors: Attend online AI training webinars and workshops
- Specific needs: Hands-on practice with AI tools mentioned in presentations
- Goals: Learn and experiment with AI creativity tools effectively, create portfolio-worthy samples during sessions

### Secondary User Segment: Workshop Presenters
- Demographics: AI educators and creatives hosting online workshops
- Current behaviors: Use webinar platforms with limited interactivity
- Specific needs: Guide participants through AI tool experimentation
- Goals: Deliver engaging, interactive learning experiences

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Launch beta platform by workshop date
- Achieve 50% participant engagement rate during interactive sessions
- Reduce passive learning time by integrating hands-on AI experimentation

### User Success Metrics
- Time to create first AI-generated asset: <5 minutes after tool introduction
- Average session engagement: >70% active participation
- Participant satisfaction score: >4.5/5 for interactive learning

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- User Sessions: 100 active sessions per month
- Tool Usage: Average 5-8 different AI tools used per session
- Collaboration Rate: 60% of creations involve group collaboration

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **User Authentication & Session Management:** Secure login with role-based access (presenter/participant)
- **Live Presentation Interface:** Presenter can share slides/screens while participants access tools
- **Integrated AI Tools:** Direct integration with 3-5 popular AI creativity tools (DALL-E API, Leonardo AI, logo generators)
- **Real-time Collaboration:** Basic shared workspace for viewing others' creations
- **Session Recording:** Save workshop outputs for participants to download

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Custom AI model training
- Advanced collaboration features (like real-time co-editing)
- Mobile native apps
- Integration with advanced design software

### MVP Success Criteria
Platform supports 100 concurrent users experimenting with AI tools during a 2-hour workshop, with >80% of participants successfully creating and sharing at least 3 creative assets during the session.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
Advanced collaboration tools, custom workflow templates, and pre-built workshop curricula.

### Long-term Vision
Become the leading platform for interactive AI education, supporting diverse creative domains from visual design to content creation to music generation.

### Expansion Opportunities
Expand to non-AI workshops, enterprise training modules, and international markets.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) on desktops/laptops
- **Browser/OS Support:** Modern browsers with WebRTC support for real-time features
- **Performance Requirements:** 2-second response time for AI tool interactions, support 100 concurrent users

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** React with TypeScript for component-based UI, real-time updates via Socket.io
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express for API endpoints and session management
- **Database:** MongoDB for user data and session storage, Redis for real-time state
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** AWS/GCP with CDN for AI tool results, WebRTC for real-time features

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with frontend and backend packages
- **Service Architecture:** Microservices for different AI tool integrations
- **Integration Requirements:** API keys for multiple AI services, secure token management
- **Security/Compliance:** GDPR compliant for user data, secure API key storage

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** $5,000-$10,000 for development and initial hosting
- **Timeline:** MVP ready in 4-6 weeks
- **Resources:** 1-2 developers + 1 backend/API integration specialist
- **Technical:** Limited to web platform, no native mobile apps

### Key Assumptions
- Major AI tool providers offer accessible APIs or integration options
- Workshop participants have reliable internet and modern browsers
- Presenters can adapt presentation style to accommodate interactive segments
- AI tool APIs remain stable and don't change access patterns significantly during development

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **API Access:** AI tool providers may restrict or change API access terms
- **Performance:** Real-time AI tool usage may cause latency with multiple users
- **Legal Issues:** Copyright considerations for user-generated AI content

### Open Questions
- Which specific AI tools have the most accessible APIs?
- How will we handle user data privacy across integrated services?
- Is a 4-6 week timeline realistic for full MVP development?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- Current API limitations of major AI creativity tools
- Best practices for real-time collaborative AI experimentation
- Legal requirements for AI-generated content ownership and usage

## Appendices

### A. Research Summary
No formal market research conducted yet, but based on workshop experience with AI education communities, there's strong demand for more interactive learning methods. Similar platforms exist but focus on video (Zoom, Google Meet) rather than AI tool integration.

### B. Stakeholder Input
Primary feedback from workshop pilot sessions: "We need a way to practice during the talk, not just listen."

- Workshop Content: "CTRL-PAIN"T AI Creativity Foundations curriculum

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Research and confirm accessible AI tool APIs
2. Design wireframes for participant and presenter interfaces
3. Set up development environment and team roles
4. Create detailed technical architecture specification
