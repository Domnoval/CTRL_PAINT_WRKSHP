# AI Creativity Workshop Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Launch beta platform by workshop date to support live AI creativity workshop sessions
- Enable 50% participant engagement rate through interactive AI tool experimentation
- Reduce passive learning time by integrating hands-on AI experimentation during presentations
- Support concurrent user sessions with real-time collaborative AI creativity activities
- Provide secure, intuitive access to 3-5 major AI creativity tools during workshop sessions
- Enable participants to create and share creative assets (logos, images, designs) within 5 minutes of tool introduction

### Background Context
This PRD addresses the need for interactive online AI creativity workshops where passive webinar experiences inhibit hands-on learning. Traditional presentation platforms lack integration with AI tools, creating a disconnect between instruction and practice. By creating an interactive platform that allows workshop participants to immediately experiment with discussed AI technologies, we can transform passive learning into active, engaging experiences that produce tangible creative outputs and better retention of AI creativity skills.
